            Create an application instance: new AppView({el: '#app_form'}). To implement View classes we need
            to inherit from dMVC.View - the main presentation class or its derivatives. Argument - the element ID,
            which is attached to the view-object.

            <strong>AppView Class fields:</strong>

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <u>commands: {"create": "createTask",...}</u> - server commands (create, delete),
            on which the view will react by calling the appropriate methods (createTask, deleteTask)
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>events: {"submit": "formSubmit"}</u> - HTML page events, on which the object is signed

            <strong>Methods:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>init</u> - it is called automatically when you create an object
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>deleteTask</u> - called, when 'delete' command received from server.
            It is call standard View object`s function 'remove'. It is designed to remove the child views.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>createTask</u> - called, when 'create' command received from server.
            Create a new TaskView object to show the task. Call the add method for joining the child object.
            In HTML markup element will be submitted by 'li' tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>formSubmit</u> - called in response to the form's submit event. For the controller notification
            is called a standard 'process' function. It gets type of rised event (createTask) and the
            data required for processing (field value in the input form)

            To create the controllers we need to implement the classes in the dMVC namespace.
            Their name should start with the type specified in the View ('type' field) + 'Controller'.
            For AppView controller we creating a dMVC.AppController class. It is necessary to
            implement the methods that will be called from the client,
            by this.process('controller_method_name') invocation. In this case, the function createTask.
            After performing the necessary logic to client request processing, it is possible
            to return a set of commands to display results. To do this, we send an array like:
            <pre>
                res.json([{command: 'create', id: record.id, text: record.task, done: record.done}])
            </pre>
        </p>
